Tonight at the Jackson County Fair Joan Jett is performing live on stage at the Lithia Motors Amphitheater.  In fact she is probably singing I love rock and roll right now.  Am I there with my camera and press pass promoting Joan Jett on JCFairgrounds.com?  The answer is no.  Instead I am here sitting on the couch at Hunter Communications writing this blog.  Maentz advertising says no photographers at Joan Jett.  I'm not sure if it's in her contract or if it's a Maentz advertising policy but how archaic are these people that they will say no to promotion from countless photographers, journalistic bodies, and websites.  I have to ask myself if this is a violation of my constitutional rights.  I'm not sure... all I know is that the Jackson County Fairgrounds is public property and as a tax payer and a member of the press I should be able to take pictures where and when I want to. 

Additionally purse size digital cameras are not regulated at concerts, nor are camera phones.  With these pocket size cameras gaining popularity I have to wonder how many low quality concert photos from these events are making it onto myspace and furthermore out to larger media bodies.  All I know is I'm a little disappointed about not being able to take pictures of Joan Jett while having photos of all the other artists at the Jackson County Fair.
