We just a little over 30 minutes away from closing the technology pvaillion for the day. Today was the last day of the fair and free admission day was an overwhelming success with attendance for a sunday higher than I have ever seen it. It was pretty cool to see all these people get to attend that thought an $8 admission was far too pricy. I have been here for 6 whole days now and I've seen and photographed almost every part of the fair.   

I've seen a lot of things out there in the crowd. A lot of interesting things and a lot of scary things. The fair has this way of making you feel so excited in the very beginning but sapping all the life out of you by the end of the week. Of course in the 4-H parts of the fair there's always drama because anytime you have teenagers you always have drama. Whether it's the horses, the pigs, or the beef it's always there. I've seen 14 year old girls hitting on guys twice their age in the carnvial. I can't help but wonder where their parents are.  

I also turned 21 this week. Which for the most part was fairly uneventful . I had a few friends tell me that we were going to hang out for my birthday but it never happened. They were all a little busy with steers or boys or anything else that could be more important. All in all turning 21 was a little disappointing. Look forward to my blog coming up on the life of curly fries. A photojournalistic piece on the 7 tons of potatoes that get served by one vendor at the fair and the 740 gallons of ketchup.
