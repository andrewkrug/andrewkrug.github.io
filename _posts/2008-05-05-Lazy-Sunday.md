Today I went to visit my Dad in Grants Pass to borrow a weedeater to wage war against my lawn. I was pleasently surprised when I got there because he bought me a shiny new weedeater which works quite well.  

Hopefully after many many hours of yard work I'll be able to find my house in the tall grass. Weedeating is hard work. For like an hour afterwards I could still feel my arm shaking. Maybe I should do it more often to get buff... not sure.   

Tomorrow the Synapse Consultants come to SOU to start implementing the Identity Manager. (More on the IDM Project Later.)
