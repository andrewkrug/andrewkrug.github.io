The Siskiyou Saxophone Workshop just has one more performance left, today the Quartets will perform at 2:00pm PST. By that time I will be long gone on my flight to Las Vegas for my next vaction activity which is to attend the Defcon 17 Hacker ... I mean Security Conference at the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas. I'll be there with several other local security professionals, Jeff McJunkin, Brandon Kester, and Daniel Defreez. Local Business owner Jim Teece will also be in attendance. By the end of the conference we will all certainly be so scared of what's to come that we will want to disconnect our internet connections.   

The Siskiyou Saxophone Workshop was great this year. I had the opportunity to play tenor in the workshop orchestra, which I really enjoyed. Up until now my orchestral experience was limited to mainly alto sax with the Siskiyou Saxophones. In the fall I'll probably end up auditioning on tenor. It was really fun to experience the Saxophone Orchestra from another section. Below is an excerpt from one of our rehearsals video by Rhett Bender. http://rhettbender.blogspot.com. Hopefully more sound bytes from the workshop to come soon! (After Defcon)
