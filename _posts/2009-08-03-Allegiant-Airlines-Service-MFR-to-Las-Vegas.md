So let me just say one thing about Allegiant Airlines, actually let me just say a few things. The ticket prices are really good for a flight out of medford Oregon going to anywhere. At $79.00 each way it's more than affordable to fly to Las Vegas for a weekend. These people however are marketing geniuses and they know how to capitalize on a concept that was first mastered in the fast food industry, the incremental upgrade.   

The tickets seem cheap enough at first but then it's $35.00 to check a bag at the gate. In flight service is good enough but doesn't include any complimentary drinks. Even a soda is $2.00\. The guide book in the front of your seat which is generally a sky mall catalog has been replaced with a booklet of Las Vegas attractions for all of which you can purchase tickets for with your Visa or Amex in flight. My hat really goes off to these people for knowing how to capitalize on an opportunity. However, I'd still like my free coke.
