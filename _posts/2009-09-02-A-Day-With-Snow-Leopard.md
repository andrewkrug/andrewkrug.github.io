The disks arrived yesterday in their neatly packed little Apple Box. They looked about the same as every other set of disks I've ever received from Apple, I could not wait to upgrade. Today around 10am I began installing Snow Leopard Server on my 24" iMac. Why server? I host a number of quicktime streaming applications on my iMac that you can only run with Server Edition.   

So the first thing I noticed after installation was that my Synergy didn't work even though the Synergy Daemon was loaded. The disc footprint was in fact smaller than before though. You can see the screenshots of before and after here.[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_CqsRlf7vT4Y/Sp29YkDRtOI/AAAAAAAAAVs/u1ZQ8ubWMog/s320/Leopard+Disk+Usage.png)][1]
