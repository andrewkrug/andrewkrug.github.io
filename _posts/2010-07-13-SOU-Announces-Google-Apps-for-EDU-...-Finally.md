We wanted to notify you that we are in the process of transitioning your email account on Groupwise to Google Apps for EDU. This new system, powered by Google, will provide Gmail to our school, as well as a suite of other Google products that will enable our organization to better communicate, share, and collaborate.  

What do I need to do?  
Nothing for now. Your old email address won't change, and you'll still have all your old messages. Once we turn on your new Google-powered account, you'll be able to search and access all your mail from any internet-connected computer. You will receive another email in a few weeks with more specific instructions.  

What will I get?  

Gigabytes of email storage. No more worries about having to delete mail.  
Instant messaging from right within your mailbox & free PC-to-PC voice calls.  
Google Calendar to schedule meetings, create events, and share calendars with others.  
Google Docs to create and share documents, spreadsheets and presentations online.  
Your own personalized Start Page, where you can access all these services.  
Access to your information from anywhere with an internet connection. You can also access your email with a mobile device.  
Where can I go for more info?  
You can visit our campus IT site for general FAQs http://www.sou.edu/it. You can also check out the Google Apps Help Center at http://www.google.com/support/a/users or watch video presentations below.
