Top Down Network Design 3rd Edition was one of the very first Cisco Press books I read while interning for a big IT Shop.  IT really prepared me to be a designer instead of just an implementer.  Today as a Systems Administrator having excellent design skills is a necessity. This book's rich systems analysis based philosophy for design can be applied to any Enterprise Project.

Oppenheimer is no stranger to the Network world and that really comes through in her book.  I own another Oppenheimer book, "Troubleshooting Campus Networks" which also really delivers in terms of relating design to real world problems.  Top Down Network Design 3rd Edition is not exception in this case.  Too often Cisco Press Books are too full of technical theory and not enough practical use cases.  However Oppenheimer manages to successfully guide you through practical exercise that relate back to the real physical infrastructure and end-user experience.  

This book will be one of the go-to books on my shelf for many years to come when starting any major IT Project.
