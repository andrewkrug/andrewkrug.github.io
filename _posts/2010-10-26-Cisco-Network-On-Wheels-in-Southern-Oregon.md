The Cisco Network on Wheels VAN came to tour Southern Oregon this week.  Friday October 22, 2010 I headed down to the Rogue Regency Inn for a vendor demo on Cisco Iron Port Security and to check out the Cisco NOW Van.  (N.O.W. stands for network on wheels.) The NOW van is just that a rolling enterprise on wheels.  It has everything from the lastest and greatest in Cisco Communications solutions to the new Cisco Unified Compute Center.  

It was truly impressive to see what neat things you can do when you invest in a single vendor philosophy like Ciscos.  One of the most impressive things I saw was the new Cisco EnergyWise solution powered by the Cisco 3750x stackable POE switch.  This switch can power 48 15.4watt VOIP phones over ethernet and still have plenty of power to spare to cascade up to 5 additional 3750s on one backplane.  Additionally because everything is POE (Power over Ethernet) it can actually sense when someone isn't at their desk and poweroff things like their phone, lava lamp, and laptop charger.  Now this may not seem like much savings, but think of a company call center with 500 phones all drawing 15.4 watts of power.  

Just by implementing Cisco EnergyWise you could pay to upgrade the entire call center to Gigabit based on power savings alone.  Now that's cool!  To read more about the Cisco Network on Wheels. Click here:
