Southern Oregon Universities Cisco 6500 Series router has been in operation for two years. Actually it's been online 474 days 22hours 52 minutes 22 seconds without going offline, until last night.   

Historical data from last nights wind storm shows wind speeds up to 21 mph. High wind in the spring generally means downed power lines and ultimately power loss.

For whatever reason this anomalous power caused our little 6500 series to fail over to the standby supervisor card. Changing our router active time from 474 days ... to 5 hours. Here's to you cat-6509 for being the most dependable device in our data center even with your outage from 3:06am - 3:12am.
