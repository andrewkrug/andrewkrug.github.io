#A Plea to SOU Computer Science

My name is Andrew Krug and I am a graduate of a dead program at SOU.  Among lots of other things stated along with my degree it asserts that I am a computer security professional.  Some people call us hackers.  In trying times like today where our own government spies on its citizens, digital identities are compromised, and malware brings fortune 100s to their knees one would ask why a university's computer science program would eliminate its securty component.

If you live in the Rogue Valley you may have read the Mail Tribune article, "SOU reboots its computer science program" avilable here http://bit.ly/VLvawE .  The article essentialy applauds SOU for listening to area business and re-tooling the CS program to include more traditional curriculum to produce "software engineers".  If you were to compare the old program and new programs side-by-side you would notice only minor changes to the programming track that once existed.

## Three new classes:

* Theory of Computation
* Computer Organization
* Programming Languages

While this is a step in the right direction and these courses were sorely lacking from the CS Curriculum before the Mail Tribune article makes it sound like SOU has solved the "problem" which was allegedly tracks that students could, "slide through".  This still doesn't explain why when the "demand for cybersecurity professionals over the past five years grew 3.5 times faster than demand for other IT jobs and about 12 times faster than for all other jobs." (http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9237394/Demand_for_IT_security_experts_outstrips_supply)

To be clear I'm not advocating for the preservation of the old at SOU.  It's time for a change. Whatever shape that change takes let's make sure it includes things that are relevant to industry and preserves what students need to graduate ready to enter the workforce.

#Three things students need most to be successful:

1. Students need experience with languages used in industry.  More than just your Java.  Sorry SOU Faculty this will mean you have to do some learning of your your own.  Python, ruby, and something a little bleeding edge too.  How about scala?

2. Students need securty integrated into every course.  Secure programming, secure application design, and reverse engineering!

3. Students need a hacker space.  What's a hacker space you might ask?

> A hacker space is a place in which people with an interest in computing or technology can gather to work on projects while sharing ideas, equipment, and knowledge.

#The planned decomissioning of the SOU Research Lab CS115

Yesterday disturbingly someone shared with me that CS is being moved from the Computer Science building at SOU.  In keeping with their systematic destruction of all things security they plan to dismantle the CS115 research lab and turn it into offices or storage or something boring like that.  This is basically saying that students don't need a hacker space.  Even in a university with no CS research program students need a place to work outside the curriculum to do cool bleeding edge things in a safe space without fear of campus IT / Security shutting them down.

During my time as a student at SOU I lived in this lab and more learning than I ever could have in the classroom.  So much learning I even wrote my capstone and creating pedagogical environments for computer science.

**The letter that follows was sent to Roy Saigo new SOU President:**


>I am writing to you in response to the planned decommissioning of the CS115 research lab facility and Computer Security Program at SOU.  I am a graduate of the Computer Science program, Security Track and worked as Systems Administrator and Senior Systems Administrator for Southern Oregon University from 2008 - 2013. Currently I work as Operations Manager for Information Technology at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Notably I am also employer to three SOU graduates.  I applaud SOU for the work it has done to date and fully recognize that in trying times offerings must be reduced.  The concept of changing the computer science curriculum is good and was needed for a long time. However, it needs to be an ongoing dialogue with industry professionals to ensure all the right things are included.

>It is my understanding that all computer security has been eliminated from the program and SOU is to return to a "traditional" computer science model with an emphasis on computer programming. Today any computer science program needs some security focus baked in to every course. We live in an era where identities are stolen, governments spy, and businesses are brought to their knees by malware and the like.  It is up to all of us as community members and educators to produce a generation of computing professionals both capable and security conscious.

>For years the CS115 lab has served as a hacker space and allowed students to practice their craft. Please consider the value of continuing to preserve a hacker space at SOU and the continued inclusion of computer security in your curriculum. I have started an open letter to SOU on change.org signed by some of industry's finest professionals in addition to former security track grads that is available at this link: http://chn.ge/1tA0qKE . I hope that we can be partners in shaping a curriculum that produces highly skilled graduates.
