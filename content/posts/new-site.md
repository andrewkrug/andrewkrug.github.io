This site was rebooted on the 24th June 2020.  The content that was here before lives in github.  The purpose of a personal portfolio has changed for me and the rest of the world since I launched andrewkrug.com back in the 1990s.  

Now I seek to use this blog space for personal experiments and security evangelism.
