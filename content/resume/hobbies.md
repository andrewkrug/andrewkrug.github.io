## Hobbies
At Southern Oregon University I pursued a libral arts education finding ways to integrate and fuse the arts into my education. I am an avid classical saxophonist and play in a number of large and small saxophone ensembles. I also enjoy the outdoors, currently having two horses that I use for trail riding and timed events.
