A chronological history of the talks I've given at various conferences.  This isn't all of them but not everyone posts recordings.  If a talk was given more than once I've picked my favorite version to post here.

**Note:** I love helping other folks hone ideas and develop presentations.  If looking for speaker mentoring please reach out.
