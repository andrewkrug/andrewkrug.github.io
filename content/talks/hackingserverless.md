Presented with: Graham Jones ( LegitScript )

Serverless technology is getting increasingly ubiquitous in the enterprise and startup
communities. As micro-services multiply and single purpose services grow, how do you audit
and defend serverless runtimes? The advantages of serverless runtimes are clear: increased
agility, ease of use, and ephemerality (i.e., not managing a fleet of “pet” servers). There is a
trade off for that convenience though: reduced transparency. We will deep dive into both public
data and information unearthed by our research to give you the full story on serverless, how it
works, and attack chains in the serverless cloud(s) Azure, AWS, and a few other sandboxes.
Who will be the victor in the great sandbox showdown?
