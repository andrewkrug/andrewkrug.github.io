Presented with: Henrik Johansson (AWS)

We dive deep into the actual code behind various security automation and remediation functions. We demonstrate each script, describe the use cases, and perform a code review explaining the various challenges and solutions. All use cases are based on customer and C-level feedback and challenges. We look at things like IAM policy scope reduction, alert and ticket integration for security events, forensics and research on AWS resources, secure pipelines, and more. Please join us for a speaker meet-and-greet following this session at the Speaker Lounge (ARIA East, Level 1, Willow Lounge). The meet-and-greet starts 15 minutes after the session and runs for half an hour.
