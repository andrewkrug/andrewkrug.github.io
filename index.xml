      <title>Five New Security Automations Using AWS Security Services &amp; Open Source</title>
      <link>https://www.andrewkrug.com/talks/sec403/</link>

      <description>Presented with: Henrik Johansson (AWS)
We dive deep into the actual code behind various security automation and remediation functions. We demonstrate each script, describe the use cases, and perform a code review explaining the various challenges and solutions. All use cases are based on customer and C-level feedback and challenges. We look at things like IAM policy scope reduction, alert and ticket integration for security events, forensics and research on AWS resources, secure pipelines, and more.</description>

      <title>Hacking Serverless Runtimes</title>
      <link>https://www.andrewkrug.com/talks/hackingserverless/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.andrewkrug.com/talks/hackingserverless/</guid>
      <description>Presented with: Graham Jones ( LegitScript )
Serverless technology is getting increasingly ubiquitous in the enterprise and startup communities. As micro-services multiply and single purpose services grow, how do you audit and defend serverless runtimes? The advantages of serverless runtimes are clear: increased agility, ease of use, and ephemerality (i.e., not managing a fleet of “pet” servers). There is a trade off for that convenience though: reduced transparency. We will deep dive into both public data and information unearthed by our research to give you the full story on serverless, how it works, and attack chains in the serverless cloud(s) Azure, AWS, and a few other sandboxes.</description>

      <title>120 Hardening AWS Environments and Automating Incident Response for AWS Compromises</title>
      <link>https://www.andrewkrug.com/talks/hardeningaws/</link>

      <guid>https://www.andrewkrug.com/talks/hardeningaws/</guid>
      <description>Presented with: Alex McCormack
Incident Response procedures differ in the cloud versus when performed in traditional, on-premise, environments. The cloud offers the ability to respond to an incident by programmatically collecting evidence and quarantining instances but with this programmatic ability comes the risk of a compromised API key. The risk of a compromised key can be mitigated but proper configuration and monitoring must be in place. The talk discusses the paradigm of Incident Response in the cloud and introduces tools to automate the collection of forensic evidence of a compromised host.</description>

Now I seek to use this blog space for personal experiments and security evangelism.

      <description>Github
What is it? A scanning integration that consumes a certificate transparency list from crt.sh for a given list of domains then scans them with the Mozilla Web Observatory. The result of the data in the form of A-F scores is then converted to a JSON payload and sent to Datadog.
What did I work on? I created this integration as part of a blog series on open source and monitoring platforms like Datadog.</description>

What is it? Mozilla’s Identity and Access Management (IAM) aim to improve the productivity of Mozillians (end-users and operational teams) by streamlining IAM management tasks while providing visibility. Additionally, IAM provides an easier and significantly safer experience for the user and for services in need of authentication.
What did I work on? The Mozilla Change Integration service and technical architecture for the platform.

      <description>ThreatResponse Github
What is it? The ThreatResponse project was started in 2013 by Andrew Krug and Alex McCormack inspired by AWS Security Geek Beetle Bailey. The goal was to help customers in the cloud perform complex and automated incident response with zero assumptions about the environment.
Later in the timeline Joel Ferrier became heavily involved as the memory acquisition expert ultimately developing MargaritaShotgun.
There was also significant investment in the UI, UX, and community from Jeff Parr.</description>
