      <description>This site was rebooted on the 24th June 2020. The content that was here before lives in github. The purpose of a personal portfolio has changed for me and the rest of the world since I launched andrewkrug.com back in the 1990s.
Now I seek to use this blog space for personal experiments and security evangelism.
