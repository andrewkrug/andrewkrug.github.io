    event: "Anticast"
    location: "Virtual"
    date: "July 2024"
    description: "CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) is at the very heart of every DevOps strategy. Whether it includes security or not, security practitioners should have familiarity with CI/CD systems. Often these systems have implicit trust, or the “keys to the kingdom,” when it comes to forming resources in cloud environments. Join us for a free one-hour Antisyphon Anti-cast, with instructor Andrew Krug, where he’ll explain best practices for CI/CD, detail common pitfalls, and get hands on with Github Actions + Cloud Providers. Andrew will cover common best practices for project layouts and discuss do’s and don’ts. You'll leave with a firm understanding of how to properly federate identity – in a safe way with cloud providers."
